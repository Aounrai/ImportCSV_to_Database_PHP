This repository is instantiated for handling CSV or other Excel  files with PHP. It has a class named as Excel in library folder 
reads the CSV file and returns data to the test1.php where the query is generated accordingly and data is inserted into the database
from the CSV file. 
The field names in database must be similar to the field names in excel sheet otherwise it won't work.
This is my first contribution to open source and it is open for suggestions to improve.
